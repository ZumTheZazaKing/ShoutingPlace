## What I used on this project
I used the following technologies for this project:

- ReactJS (A Javascript Framework)
- SASS (A CSS Framework)
- Material UI (A React UI Framework)
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)


## Where is the source code?

All the important source code can be found in the 'src' folder on the 'master' branch.
In the src folder, contains many javascript files with one css file called 'App.css' being the main css file and 'input.scss' being the SASS input for it

Before digging through the code, I'll apologize beforehand. The code is quite a mess


## Where can I access this project's output?

You can see the social platform itself by using the following link: http://shoutingplace.netlify.app


## Why I made this project?

I made this project so I could submit it to a competition called PRIN2021 and also for fun


## Any future plans?

Well, I'm thinking of adding private messaging since someone I know suggested it to me. Seems like a great idea!!
